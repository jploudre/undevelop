ICD-10 Regex

According to www.cms.gov ICD-10 has the following rules:

* 3-7 Characters
* Character 1 is alpha (cannot be U)
* Character 2 is numeric
* Characters 3-7 are alphanumeric
* After 3 characters you use a decimal

Alpha characters are not case sensitive
Here is the regex I came up with:

^[A-TV-Z][0-9][A-Z0-9](\.[A-Z0-9]{1,4})?$
